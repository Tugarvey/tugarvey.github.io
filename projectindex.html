<p> Sherrif Marshmellow has been working for the Tunasalad County Police Department for a long time. 3 <emp> HARD, LONG YEARS </emp>. This image captured by
  a passing hiker shows the darker side of working on the right side of the law. Moments before this image was taken, Sherrif Pom-Pom Marshmello was told that
  his favorite ducky-plush, Margarine, has been kidnapped by the infamous Sir Booties. Will he be able to save his best friend, or will this go down as the final
  straw, Sir Booties greatest crime yet? </p>
